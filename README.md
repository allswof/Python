Code snippets for working with Excel files

This repository has some functions and big "chunks" of code calling them. It was made to clean and process lectures from a Plasma Quantum MS Elite. Having realized that Excel can't import the xml file exported by the machine, this program takes imput from copied-pasted data to a Excel file.
The libraries used are Pandaas and SimpleGUI.
The code should be easy to modify to accomodate for other inductively coupled plasm mass spectromety meters.
